Centrarium is a custom theme for Jekyll, made by [Ben Centra][bencentra] for his own blog. He'd be humbled if you liked it enough to use it as well! Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).

## Did you stumble upon this website by some chance?

It is completely usesless. <br>
There is nothing of value here.<br><br>
*Enjoy I guess?*
